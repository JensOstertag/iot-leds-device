## About
This software allows to control WS2812B LED strips over WiFi using an ESP8266 microcontroller, as other controls often fail to allow customization of animations and often have proprietary controls.
It is designed to be used with a WeMos D1 Mini, which is a small and inexpensive development board based on the ESP8266.
Thus, the firmware can be flashed to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.

The counterpart to this software, the web application ([JensOstertag/iot-leds-web](https://github.com/JensOstertag/iot-leds-web)), allows users to create their own animations.
